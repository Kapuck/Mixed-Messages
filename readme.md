## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to learn how to use git, repositories, and build programs in my own development ecosystem instead of in the Codecademy browser development environment. To this end, I am building a random *Dungeons and Dragons* character idea generator. The generator will churn out a message with an alignment, race, and class every time the user runs the program.

## Technologies

* Node.js v12.18.3

## Setup

To run this project, install locally and launch from the command line.

## Scope

### Features

* Randomly generate your character's alignment, race, and class
